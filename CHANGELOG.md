# Changelog

All notable changes to pisynth, in plain language. Newest first.

## 0.3.0 — 2026-05-21

### Added
- **Bluetooth speaker output** — pick a Bluetooth audio device in Settings → Audio.
- **Metronome** — Settings → Tools → Metronome: set BPM and beats, with a click and beat dots.
- **MIDI keyboard picker** — Settings → MIDI: choose which keyboard plays (or "Auto", all of them).
- **MIDI test keyboard** — a live on-screen piano that lights up as you play, to check your
  keyboard sends notes (works even when the synth isn't running).
- **Audio device picker** — choose the USB sound card, with a "Test sound" button.
- **Home status icons** — Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, keyboard, synth, sound card, metronome, and a
  system-health smiley (green / amber / red).
- **System menu** — hardware & software info, reboot, power off, reset config.
- **Connectivity menu** — separate Wi-Fi / Bluetooth toggles and an airplane mode.
- **One-command installer** — `install.sh` on the Pi (and `install.ps1` for Windows),
  with a shared `packages.list`.

### Changed
- The touch UI was rebuilt as a clean, layered package (core / io / ui / screens) — same
  look, easier to extend.
- Volume steps by 1% and supports press-and-hold; on-screen notices fade by themselves.

### Fixed
- The Bluetooth manager no longer freezes the UI, and audio no longer runs away on the
  Bluetooth / HDMI path.
- The "restarting audio…" notice clears itself, and the audio icon reflects a real sound card.

## 0.2 — earlier
- Touchscreen UI with soundfont/preset tiles, gain control and touch calibration; the
  synth boots straight to a playable instrument; migration-based deploy workflow.
